#Restricted Items List

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#How to add items to the restricted list? Here is an example:
#
# - itemID:DataValue:Description:BannedReason
#
# itemID -> represents the item ID
# DataValue -> represents the item damage value, to cover all values use *
# Description -> here you can type anything, it's useful to type the item name so you know what item you banned
# BannedReson -> (optional) Here you can provide a reason to let your players know why this item is restricted, the reason will be sent to players when they try to get/interact with a banned item.
#
# Example:
# - 7:*:Bedrock:You can't get this item!
# - 383:50:CreeperEgg:Used to grief
